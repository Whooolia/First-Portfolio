			<h1>My Background</h1><br><br>
				<p>I was born and raised in a small city called Ulsan, South Korea. I currently work at the Waldorf Hilton as a receptionist. Before I came here, I had lived in Australia, which was an eye-opening and a once in a lifetime experience. During this time, I gained some essential life skills. I learned how to work as team independently, manage to meet tight deadlines. Most importantly, I aquired communication skills in different langugage with people who have different backgrounds.</p><br>
				<p>I came back Korea to complete my degree in Hotel & Tourism management. After that, I have moved in London last Sepetember, and I thought I got a dream job in London, which is my current job. However, there are something else I am eager for, and after working almost a year, I realised this career choice was not for me. From that point on, my life has changed.</p><br><br>

						<h3 style="margin-top:-33px">Why do I want to learn coding?</h3>
						<div>
						<p> I've always wanted to learn something which is life-long term skill. I think programming is an empowering ability. The fact that you could build anything you want in your head, made me obssessed with learning coding.</p>

						<p>Not only just for fun, but also I could help people, or face the challenges and overcome them, and make life more efficient. Most importantly, I want to utilize my creativity and build something unique. That is why, I have started coding journey, and I am ready to dive in deep and <span>be a lifelong learner.</span></p>

						<h3>Why do I need this bootcamp?</h3>
						<p> I have been learning HTML, CSS and JS since May 2018, and loving it ever since. To make my dream come true which is being a front-end developer in short time, I would like to be surrouned by people who have <span>same interests, and similar goals.</span></p>
						<p>Most importantly, I like <span>sharing my knowledge and helping people</span>. So I'd love to contribute my skills to others at the same time that are encouraging people and giving and getting more motivation. Lastly, I want to be experienced when it comes to <span>make projects as a team</span>, before I enter in the real world of web development.</p>
						<p>This is the reason why I want to be part of Founders & Coders which is a perfect place to <span>boost my skills and increase my ability.</span></p>

I look forward to spread my positivity and motivation at Founders & Coders.<p>I am the one who isn't afraid of trying new things and learn from mistakes and others. Moreover, I am good at organizing tasks to meet the deadline.</p><p>Last but not least, my <span>passion</span> to learn coding will never go down. (Too late to cool off!) I really think that the chance of being a part of Founders & Coders will be a stepping stone for the career which I want to pursue.  </p>
